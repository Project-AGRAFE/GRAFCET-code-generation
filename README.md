# GRAFCET-code-generation
Transformation generating PCL code (IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST)) from IEC 60848 GRAFCET instances.

# Installation
- The provided code is an Eclipse plug-in project and depends on the GRAFCET-editor provided [here](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-editor).
- Set up the GRAFCET editor as explained [here](https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-editor).
- Import the projects from this repository into the same Eclipse workspace as the GRAFCET-editor.

# Run the code generation
- Run the editor by creating a new runtime using _Run Configurations --> Eclipse Application_.
- Create a .grafcet file or [import one] (https://github.com/Project-AGRAFE/GRAFCET-instances).
- The code generation is two-step: a model-to-model transformation followed by a model-to-text transformation: Right-klick the .grafcet file and choose _GRAFCET --> Generate PLC Model_ a folder containing ST-code-model will be created containing a .xmi file. Right-klick the .xmi file _--> Acceleo Model to Text --> Generate Structured Text_. Again a folder will be created containing an [PLCopenXML file](https://www.plcopen.org/technical-activities/xml-exchange) containing the generated ST code.
